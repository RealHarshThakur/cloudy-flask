# Users service

This microservice is used to implement JWT based authentication and authorization to different user actions. 
I've written a template which can be easily modified where users are classified into :
- Regular users
- Admin
- Root

I've also written decorators for the users type which you can easily use in the users actions to restrict or permit access.
